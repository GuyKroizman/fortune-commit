<!-- Plugin description -->
We all know the importance of a good commit message.  
... But if you are going to squash your commits anyway, why bother?  
This plugin automagically fills for you the git's commit text-box with a random message.  
No AI, No network is used.  
Save your time and your brain for the important stuff.
